    <h1>What is FTC? </h1>
    <p> 

        'It's way more than building robots. FIRST Tech Challenge teams (up to 15 team members, grades 7-12) 
        are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge 
        in an alliance format.
        Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop STEM skills and practice engineering principles, 
        while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and working as a team.' - First Tech Challenge
