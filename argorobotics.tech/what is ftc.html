        'It's way more than building robots. FIRST Tech Challenge teams (up to 15 team members, grades 7-12) 
        are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge 
        in an alliance format.
        Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop STEM skills and practice engineering principles, 
        while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and working as a team.' - First Tech Challenge

        The FIRST Tech Challenge is a unique and inclusive platform that warmly welcomes participants from all 
        skill levels, whether technical or non-technical. It creates a nurturing space where both students and 
        adults can contribute their existing talents, ranging from coding and electronics to metalworking, graphic 
        design, web creation, and even public speaking and videography. This diverse skill set is not just encouraged 
        but is seen as a cornerstone of the challenge. Adult coaches play a pivotal role in this ecosystem, guiding 
        students not only to enhance their skills but also to build confidence within a supportive and inclusive environment. 
        This approach ensures that everyone, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to grow, learn, and contribute 
        in meaningful ways.
